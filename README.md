# LinkedIn Suggested Posts Remover Browser extension
A browser extension to remove the "Suggested" posts from your LinkedIn feed. They are often of low content value, if not completely dumb.

Example of content that will be removed:
![Suggested post from LinkedIn such as this one will be removed](/docs/cover.png "Suggested post from LinkedIn such as this one will be removed")
